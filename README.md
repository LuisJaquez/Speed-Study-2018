# Progress towards my learning goals

In each folder, separated by year, are my notes, etc related to what I'm studying, doing, learning...

## 2018

My main goal for this year is to learn everything I need to be a competent professional software developer. For that I will follow the guides Get Job ready-Javascript Edition and CS Intensive.

My other goals are: Finish writing the book that I started 4 months ago and improve my English and French fluently (Very necessary).
